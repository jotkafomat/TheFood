# TheFood


## Description:
An application for searching and displaying recipes using the Guardian API. 
Fetches the recipes using this API call.
The motivation behind this project was to use it to consolidate my knowledge about SwiftUI, Combine, XCTest. I also want to create a user-friendly interface that would allow
searching and finding recipes easy.
I try to recreate the Guardian's app design as close as possible.  

## Technologies:
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- XCTest
- SwiftLint
- Kingfisher

## Features:
- Browsing the latest recipes on Discovery Page
- Searching recipes by ingredients, author or by other search keys.
