I remember once, when my uncle came back from Devon with two precious pots of the stuff for us, I immediately set to baking a batch of scones, which we ate warm from the oven with jam, lashings of that amazing cream and butter (to this day, I always have my scones with cream <em>and</em> butter). So it was with delight, many years later on a blistering hot day in Tlacotalpan, Mexico, that I came across a woman selling a basket of cakes made from clotted cream. I can still taste them as I write this.</p> <h2>Clotted cream loaf cake with elderflower drizzle and macerated strawberries</h2> <p>Elderflower, vanilla, strawberries and lemon in a squidgy, almond, creamy loaf cake.</p> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>1 hr</strong><br>Serves <strong>10-12</strong></p> <p><strong>200g butter</strong>, softened, plus extra to grease<br><strong>200g caster sugar</strong>,<strong> </strong>plus extra to macerate the strawberries<strong><br>1 tsp vanilla essence<br>4 eggs<br>150ml clotted cream</strong>,<strong> </strong>plus extra to serve<strong> <br>1 lemon</strong>, zested and juiced<strong><br>150g plain spelt flour<br>100g ground almonds<br>½ tsp salt<br>1</strong><strong>½ tsp baking powder<br>300g strawberries</strong></p> <p>For the drizzle<strong><br>100ml elderflower cordial</strong><strong><br>2 tsp caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas 3.

Add the eggs one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Whisk in the cream and lemon zest, then fold in the flour, ground almonds, salt and baking powder.</p> <p>Transfer to the greased tin, smooth out the top and bake for one hour, until a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the centre.</p> <p>Meanwhile, heat the cordial and sugar in a small pan and, once the sugar dissolves, take off the heat and stir in the juice of half the lemon.

Add the remaining lemon juice and a sprinkling of caster sugar, toss and leave to macerate while the cake bakes.</p> <p>Once the cake is out of the oven, pierce the top all over with a skewer, then drizzle with the syrup. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then run a butter knife around the edge to loosen, turn out on to a rack and leave to cool. Slice and serve with the strawberries and more clotted cream on the side.</p> <h2>And for the rest of the week …</h2> <p>Mash leftover strawberries in the elderflower drizzle and lemon zest and stir through vanilla ice-cream, or make a quick vanilla, elderflower and strawberry chia jam for a batch of fresh scones.</p>",

               "body":"<p><em>Caciocavallo</em> is a <em>formaggio a pasta filata</em>, or stretched-curd cheese, and part of the family that includes mozzarella, scamorza, provolone and halloumi. To make it, cow’s milk curds are kneaded and stretched by hand in hot water until they look like a fabulously long scarf of white putty. The process at this point, by the way, is almost exactly the same as that of mozzarella, for which the lengths are squeezed into balloon-like balls and<em> mozzate</em> (cut). However, for <a href=\"https://cheese.com/caciocavallo/\">caciocavallo</a>, the stretched lengths are rolled into balls, then soaked in brine before being bound with rope in pairs, neck to neck, and hung to mature <em>a cavallo</em>, or<em> </em>straddled over a beam or pole. Some say this position provides the name, but there are several other legends.</p> <p>Hanging also exaggerates the shape, which is like a pear or teardrop. Or a Japanese<a href=\"https://mykombini.com/en/14820-spirited-away-ookiku-yurayura-okiagari-koboshi-ensky-4970381454722.html\"> okiagari-koboshi</a>, a roly-poly toy that, regardless of how hard you try, always returns to an upright position when it’s knocked over – a symbol of perseverance and resilience, which seem particularly useful qualities these days. When it is young (one to three months), caciocavallo is pale, tender, bounces like a child’s cheek if you squeeze it, and has a mild and milky flavour. As it ages, it firms up and the flavour gets deeper, nuttier and almost spicy. All ages can be eaten just so, grated or cubed for cooking, and are suitable for this week’s recipe, <em>cacio all’argentiera</em> (cheese silversmith-style), as are the rest of the family (mozzarella, scamorza, provolone, halloumi …). There is a legend – of course – that the dish was invented in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Via+Argenteria,+90133+Palermo+PA,+Italy/@38.1176131,13.3640269,20z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x1319e5f4a7bb7421:0xcb564fa40cb39de4!8m2!3d38.1176332!4d13.3642576\">via dell’Argenteria</a> in Palermo by the wife of a silversmith who couldn’t afford rabbit, so created a dish with an equally enviable smell. The smell is pretty extraordinary, as oregano – which is at its very best here, warm and wild – meets the sweetness of honey, acidity of vinegar and just a bit of chilli, then all of them settle into the folds of melted cheese.</p> <p>Some recipes for <em>cacio all’argentiera</em> suggest that the slices of cheese should remain intact and have a deep, golden crust, but I am not sure how this is compatible with the cheese melting properly, which is vital if the other ingredients are going to mingle and sink in. And surely a melted mess is part of the pleasure – scooping the chaos of cheese with a corner of bread, or a chip. For me, this dish is Sicily in the summer: cooking dinner on our carpark-flat roof in the middle of Gela, drinking cheap, cold wine and baking cheese on a barbecue whose thin legs look as if they really should buckle, but never do – and making the neighbours jealous with the enticing smell, apparently.</p> <h2><strong>Fried cheese with honey, oregano and vinegar</strong></h2> <p>Prep <strong>5 min</strong><br>Cook<strong> 10 min</strong><br>Serves<strong> 4 as starter or sharing dish, 2 as a main course<br><br></strong><strong>1 tbsp runny honey<br></strong><strong>1-2 tbsp red-wine vinegar <br>1 </strong><strong>big pinch dried oregano<br>1 </strong><strong>pinch </strong><strong>red chilli flakes<br>1 </strong><strong>pinch </strong><strong>salt<br>Olive oil<br>4 x 5-6mm-thick slices </strong><strong>caciocavallo, scamorza, provola, or 8 </strong><strong>slices halloumi</strong></p> <p>In a small bowl, whisk the honey, vinegar, oregano, chilli and salt with a fork.</p> <p>In a pan, warm a little olive oil over a medium heat, then add the slices of cheese and cook for three minutes, or until a light crust has formed. Using a spatula, turn over (don’t worry if it sticks a bit) and cook for another three minutes, so the slices are bubbling gently and, while not completely collapsed, considerably melted.</p> <p>Pour the honey mixture over the cheese, leave to bubble for 10 seconds, then turn off the heat, cover and leave for a minute before serving.</p> <p>To make this on a barbecue, take a double layer of foil and crunch up the edges to create a lip. Rub the inside of the package with olive oil and put on a coolish area of the barbecue for a minute, then lay in the cheese and cook until bubbling. Pour over the honey mixture and leave to bubble for a couple of minutes more before serving.</p>",

               "body":"<p>Last year, on a <a href=\"https://www.sdg2advocacyhub.org/chefmanifesto\">Chef’s Manifesto</a> trip to Kew Gardens, we met the horticulturist <a href=\"http://helenadove.com/\">Helena Dove</a> in the kitchen gardens, where she told us about how the changing climate and shifting weather patterns are creating new challenges for farmers – for example, as the summers get hotter, and heatwaves more common, plants will <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/why-do-plants-bolt-2539753\">bolt</a> and flower much more easily. This is a particular issue with leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach and cabbage, which need to be harvested before they shoot up. Dove gets around the problem by growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/13/cooking-with-celtuce-the-supermodel-of-vegetables\">celtuce</a> (AKA asparagus lettuce) as part of her crop rotation because, unlike other lettuces, this thick-stemmed member of the family can still be harvested after it has bolted with little effect on flavour.</p> <p>Fortunately, both wilted and bolted lettuce are great to cook with, and will work alongside, or replace, leafy greens in any dish that calls for them. Bolted lettuce can sometimes be a little bitter, but, like chicory, it’s also wonderful barbecued, pan roasted or in a cheesy gratin.</p> <h2>Pea and lettuce gratin</h2> <p>Each growing season, when the sun heats up, the lettuce on our veg patch bolts, shooting up towards the sky in its determination to reproduce. We always allow some of them to “flower”, to provide food for the bees, and the rest we cook like chicory, baking it into cheesy gratins or barbecuing it over hot coals. This dish works well with both wilted or bolted lettuce. Another simple dish to make with limp or bolted lettuce is the classic <em>petits pois à la </em><em>f</em><em>rançaise</em> – simply saute roughly chopped lettuce and spring onions in butter with peas and a touch of garlic, then finish with a touch of stock.</p> <p><strong>150ml hot stock</strong> (vegetable, chicken or beef), or water<br><strong>150ml double cream</strong> (or a non-dairy alternative)<br><strong>40g butter</strong>, or 40ml extra-virgin olive oil <br><strong>3 spring onions</strong>, roughly chopped<strong><br>100g peas</strong> (fresh or frozen)<br><strong>150g lettuce</strong> (whole ones work best), cut into wedges or large pieces<br><strong>1 small garlic clove</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>Grated parmesan</strong> (or a non-dairy alternative), to finish</p> <p>Put the stock and cream in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer until reduced by half. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a high heat, add the spring onions, peas and lettuce, and saute, stirring occasionally, for three minutes, until the lettuce begins to wilt but still has some bite. Stir in the garlic, saute for a minute more, then pour in the cream mix and season to taste. Sprinkle generously with grated parmesan, place under a very hot grill for three minutes, until it browns and bubbles, then remove and serve hot.</p>",

You can make it with just about any fruit you like, turn it vegan, dress it up for a special occasion or make it so healthy, you could even have it for breakfast. Fool: it’s surprisingly clever stuff.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min, + cooling</strong><br>Cook <strong>15 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>450g rhubarb</strong>, or other seasonal fruit (see step 1)<br><strong>5 tbsp sugar</strong><br><strong>300ml double cream</strong>, chilled<br><strong>100ml Greek yoghurt</strong>, chilled (optional; see step 6)</p> <h2>1 Pick your fruit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6bb6e1ca6f68a26d14c4a99f07eed5d7cdca14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6bb6e1ca6f68a26d14c4a99f07eed5d7cdca14d/0_170_10328_6726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 01\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It’s still early summer, so I’ve suggested rhubarb, but you can use your own favourite fruit. Most don’t even need cooking (see step 5), but of those that do, you can swap gooseberries, fresh currants or apples for the rhubarb, or use apricots, peaches or plums that aren’t quite ripe enough to eat raw. Add sugar to taste, because different fruits need different amounts.</p> <h2>2 Chop the fruit and add sugar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc547c89ab50f4a4e24666e78dbb7dd98db1fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc547c89ab50f4a4e24666e78dbb7dd98db1fa0/0_710_7635_5550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 02\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Roughly chop the rhubarb into short sections (there’s no need to chop up currants or berries, but you’ll need to chop and stone peaches, etc), then put in a medium pan with four tablespoons of sugar.</p> <p>Caster sugar melts nice and quickly, but any sort will work (brown sugar has a particularly nice flavour), or use honey or golden syrup instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29e19fcbf5b2c4b42ab8d0f7ef2799c6a50f07ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29e19fcbf5b2c4b42ab8d0f7ef2799c6a50f07ae/0_488_10328_6613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 03\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>3 Alternative sweeteners</h2> <p>If you like, swap out some of the sugar for a flavoured syrup: rhubarb works well with half sugar, half ginger syrup (from a jar of stem ginger), while gooseberries are lovely with elderflower cordial, but play around with what you have to hand. If you’re feeling adventurous, you could also add some finely grated orange or lemon zest, or some fresh ginger, to the pan.</p> <h2>4 Cook the fruit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec59ca7f8da6383aa8027e7f138bf7872b5b44b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec59ca7f8da6383aa8027e7f138bf7872b5b44b/0_648_10328_6181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 04\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Put the pan on a medium-low heat and cover. Cook until the fruit is tender and you can pierce it easily with a fork, then take off the lid, turn up the heat slightly and leave it to bubble away until some of the juice has evaporated – don’t worry if rhubarb disintegrates or berries burst.</p> <h2>5 Drain and cool</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335e516b7b71c8071a9da6f8e0989807fab3b03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335e516b7b71c8071a9da6f8e0989807fab3b03c/0_579_10328_6340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 05\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Taste the cooked fruit, remembering that it will be hot, and add more sugar, if need be. Pour into a sieve set above a bowl to catch the juices, then leave to cool. If you’re using fruit that doesn’t need cooking, remove any stems or stones, roughly chop it if it’s big, then mash to a chunky puree with a fork and stir in the sugar (icing sugar is best here).</p> <h2>6 Whip the cream…</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fca63d5387c85b2ce3e6994c668e52d736801bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fca63d5387c85b2ce3e6994c668e52d736801bd/483_306_7127_5501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 06\" width=\"1000\" height=\"772\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pour the chilled cream into a large bowl and use a whisk (or electric beaters or a food mixer) to beat it until it stands up in soft, droopy peaks. I mix in a little yoghurt to make the fool a bit lighter, but you can use 400ml cream, or drain off the liquid from 400ml yoghurt to make it really thick and use that instead. Vanilla seeds are a good addition, too.</p> <h2>7 … or a vegan alternative</h2> <p>To make your fool vegan, substitute a mixture of thick, plant-based yoghurt and whippable, plant-based cream for the above, or whizz up 300g drained silken tofu in a food processor until smooth, then fold in 100ml whipped plant-based cream. Brands vary, so you may need to chill it until it solidifies before folding in the fruit.</p> <h2>8 Add the fruit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99a99591bf8a09c28d88a36fe2ca1ec9c69826a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a99591bf8a09c28d88a36fe2ca1ec9c69826a5/6030_2613_2788_2955/943.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s easy fruit fool for Feast kids issue 07\" width=\"943\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Gently fold the cooled fruit into the whipped dairy, so you get a ripple effect, rather than a smooth mixture; take care not to be too rough, or you’ll knock the air out of the cream.</p> <p>Serve at once, preferably in a glass bowl, with the cooking juices in a jug for people to pour on top. Or refrigerate the fool, covered so it doesn’t absorb any other flavours from the fridge, until you’re ready to eat it.</p> <h2>9 Variations</h2> <p>Turn the fool into an Eton mess by folding in crumbled meringue along with the fruit, or mix things up with pieces of biscuit, mini marshmallows, granola, honeycomb, chocolate chunks, caramel sauce, pieces of birthday cake … the only limit is your imagination. To turn your fool into a showstopper, pile it up in a large dish, cover it in hundreds and thousands or edible glitter, and add some birthday candles.</p>",

               "body":"<p>Tlayudas (pronounced clah-yoo-dahs) are Mexican-style pizzas cooked over charcoal grills, and are usually eaten late at night on the streets of Oaxaca. There, the dough is made with corn, but here I make my own simple wheat tortillas or, if I’m in a rush, use ready-made ones from the shops. Toasted in a frying pan, topped with a variety of things and finished off under the grill until the cheese is melted and bubbling, they go down incredibly well.</p> <h2>Tlayudas with pea hummus, sun-dried tomatoes and mozzarella</h2> <p>We love the combination of pea hummus and sun-dried tomatoes, but you can spread the tortillas with anything you want, including dulce de leche, bananas and toasted hazelnuts.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>50 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>6-8 children</strong></p> <p><strong>200g peas</strong>, fresh or frozen<strong><br>200g tinned chickpeas</strong>,<strong> </strong>drained and rinsed<br><strong>1 small garlic clove</strong>,<strong> </strong>crushed with a little salt<br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>3 tbsp olive oil, </strong>plus extra to serve<strong><br>1 tbsp tahini<br></strong><strong>1 big handful fresh mint</strong>, leaves picked, plus extra to serve<strong><br>2 lemons<br>4 large wheat tortillas<br>60g sun-dried tomatoes</strong>,<strong> </strong>roughly chopped<br><strong>100g mozzarella</strong>, grated<strong><br>Parmesan</strong>, to serve (optional)<br><strong>Lettuce</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Make the hummus first. Bring a small pan of water to a boil, drop in the peas and cook for three minutes, until just tender. Drain and run under cold water for 10-20 seconds, to cool.</p> <p>Tip the peas into a food processor, add the chickpeas, garlic, a teaspoon of salt, olive oil, tahini, mint, the juice of one lemon and a tablespoon of water, and season generously. Blitz until nice and smooth, then check the seasoning, adding lemon if it needs more acidity or a little water for a more spoonable consistency.</p> <p>Heat the grill. Meanwhile, lay a tortilla in a large, ovenproof frying pan and turn the heat to medium-low so it warms through gently. Spread a quarter of the hummus all over the surface of the tortilla, then scatter over some sun-dried tomatoes and a quarter of the mozzarella on top. </p> <p>Pop the pan under the hot grill and cook until the cheese has melted, but take care that you do not burn the tortilla.</p> <p>Remove from the grill, scatter over a few mint leaves and parmesan (if using), drizzle with a little oil and cut into slices, much like a pizza. Serve with lemon wedges and a bowl of crisp lettuce while you repeat with the rest of the tortillas and toppings.</p> <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week …</strong></h2> <p>You will have a handful of chickpeas left over: toast them in a separate frying pan with a teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika for a fun extra topping. And, for a proper Mexican finish, try topping the finished tlayudas with some chargrilled spring onions.</p>",
