            body: "<p>If you think it’s a good plan to squeeze more vegetables into your diet, but, like me, don’t have the bandwidth in the mornings for green juices and smoothies, then this is the perfect dish for you. It has all the comfort and joy of a classic, creamy carbonara, but with heaps of delicious, lighter-than-light, ribboned courgetti to complement the more substantial pasta and scoop up the garlicky, pancetta-flecked sauce.</p> <h2><strong>Courgetti carbonara</strong></h2> <p>If you can find both yellow and green courgettes, they’ll add a stunning, two-tone colour to an otherwise pale dish.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>25 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium courgettes<br>Salt and black pepper<br>200g spaghetti <br>3 medium eggs</strong><br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>75g grated </strong><strong>parmesan or pecorino</strong> (or a mix), plus extra to serve<strong><br>100g smoked pancetta cubes<br>3 small garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<strong><br></strong><strong>1 handful </strong><strong>roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Prepare the courgettes: use a julienne peeler or sharp knife to peel them into long, fine strips, stopping when you get to the seedy core– you want about 500g – then set aside; discard the cores. </p> <p>Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, season well and stir in the cheese.</p> <p>Put a large, wide frying pan over a medium heat and stir-fry the pancetta for five minutes, by which time it will have begun to release its fat. Add the garlic, cook for another few minutes, until the pancetta and garlic are golden, then remove from the heat.</p> <p>Once the spaghetti is al dente, return the pancetta to the heat and use tongs or forks to transfer the pasta to the pancetta pan, reserving the cooking water.</p> <p>Add the courgettes to the pan with a big splash of the reserved cooking water and stir well for a few minutes, so everything is coated in the garlicky oil. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg mix until you have a lovely, glossy sauce, adding enough cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to get it to a creamy consistency.</p> <p>Transfer to hot plates, sprinkle with a little extra cheese and the parsley, and serve immediately.</p> <h2>And for the rest of the week …</h2> <p>I love to put a speed peeler to a courgette, yellow or otherwise, then toss it in olive oil and lemon juice and serve as part of a salad. Freeze any leftover pancetta for another recipe another day.</p>",

            body: "<p>There is nothing new about tables outside restaurants, but not like this. Small clusters of tables are now swarms, and single rows three deep, while ping-pong table-sized decks have quadrupled in size and commercial umbrella manufacturers must be doing very well indeed. It has been interesting to see how all the different<em> locali </em>– bars, <em>trattorie</em>, <em>pizzerie</em> – have responded to the provisional permission to occupy all available space in front of their establishments until the end of the year. Some have constructed elegant platforms with parquet or matt grey decking, and furnished them with steady tables and padded chairs. I am keener on resourcefulness, my favourite being the trattoria that spread artificial turf over a large segment of bumpy road and put plastic picnic tables on it, which last only a few days<strong>, </strong>but will live long in the memory.</p> <p>I imagine the owners are wandering around looking at their neighbours’ set-ups, sniffing out who has more seats or invested in bigger umbrellas. I wonder who is cooperating, and who is cursing those with a wide pavement and five parking spaces. One thing is certain, and not just in Rome: it is the most beautiful sight to see all this temporary inside-out, to see things back open and people sitting at well-spaced tables, whether on tarmac, decking or pea-green fake grass.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no fake grass in this week’s recipe. There are peas, though – fresh or frozen – and pieces of lamb, cooked in a dish known as <em>abbacchio in spezzatino con piselli</em> or, simply, <em>spezzatino con piselli.</em> Whatever you choose to call it, the dish is a bit of stove alchemy. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treccani\">encyclopedia Treccani</a>’s description of spezzatino is satisfying, because it both sums up the process neatly and, at the same time, offers a world of possibilities (there is a recipe-writing lesson here). Pardon my translation, but it goes something like this: “Spezzatino,<em> s, m</em> (derives from <em>spezzare</em>, to break); a simple dish made in homes, consisting of small pieces of meat, maybe floured, browned in a pan with oil or butter, then wet with wine, tomato, salt, pepper and various herbs, and left to cook over a low flame, with the subsequent addition of celery, carrot, onions, potatoes or peas. The best cut of lamb for this is shoulder, and the best place to buy that is from a butcher who works with a good farmer or, better still, direct from the farmer.”</p> <p>I have intentionally left the pea cooking time wide open, because so much depends on both the peas and you. If you are using fresh peas that are very tender and tiny, and you would like them to stay that way, they will need only a few minutes, while starchy ones will need longer. However, if, like me, you want the peas to absorb lots of flavour and not only don’t mind, but actively like, that they go muggy green, they can have 15-20 minutes in with the meat. I also think this dish is better after a rest, in which case the peas are even more muggy and delicious, especially when served with boiled new potatoes or a doorstop of bread, and even more so if eaten inside out. <br></p> <h2><strong>Lamb and peas (</strong><em><strong>Abbacchio in spezzatino con piselli</strong></em><strong>)</strong></h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>50 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>800g boneless lamb shoulder</strong>, cut into 3cm chunks <br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>1 tbsp flour<br></strong><strong>1 garlic clove</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled and<strong> </strong>minced<strong> </strong><br><strong>2 </strong><strong>sprigs </strong><strong>rosemary</strong>, one picked and leaves minced, the other left whole<br><strong>100ml red-wine vinegar<br>200ml white wine</strong>, plus extra to taste<strong> <br>300g peas </strong>(fresh or frozen)</p> <p><br>In a heavy-based pan or casserole, warm the oil over a medium-low heat and, working in batches, brown the lamb on all sides.</p> <p>Put all the browned meat back in the pan, add a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper, the flour, garlic, the minced rosemary and the whole sprig, and stir well. Pour over the vinegar and white wine, and stir again. Bring up to a lively simmer, then reduce to a steady one, cover and leave to bubble gently for 35-45 minutes; lift the lid every now and then to check there is enough liquid, and top up with wine or water, if necessary.</p> <p>In the last five to 20 minutes of cooking, add the peas and a little more wine if you think it’s needed to cook the peas and make sure the final dish is softly saucy.</p>",

            body: "<p>When my children were little, this was a very popular cake, and it’s not just nostalgia that makes me cook it still. Adding cornflour along with the plain flour makes for a wonderfully light and tender sponge, but it is definitely one of those cakes that needs to be eaten on the day it’s made. And while it’s the perfect, smile-inducing birthday cake, I often make it without sprinkling hundreds and thousands – just the dark gleaming icing that drapes over the top and drips thickly down the sides – for an anytime treat for older eaters.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes up to 12 small slices</strong></em><em><strong><br>For the sponge</strong></em><strong><br>plain flour</strong> 200g <br><strong>eggs</strong> 4<br><strong>Bird’s custard powder </strong>3 tbsp <br><strong>soft butter</strong> 225g <br><strong>baking powder</strong> 2 tsp <br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 200g <br><strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong> ½ tsp <br><strong>milk</strong> 2-3 tbsp</p> <p><em><strong>F</strong></em><em><strong>or the buttercream filling</strong></em><br><strong>icing sugar</strong> 125g <br><strong>soft unsalted butter</strong> 75g <br><strong>Bird’s custard powder</strong> 4 tsp <br><strong>boiling water</strong> 1½ tsp</p> <p><em><strong>F</strong></em><em><strong>or the chocolate icing</strong></em><br><strong>water</strong> 60ml <br><strong>dark chocolate </strong>175g <br><strong>golden syrup</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>hundreds and thousands</strong> 1-2 tbsp <br><strong>caster sugar </strong>125g, or use 50g if using milk chocolate</p> <p>Make sure everything you need is at room temperature before you start. Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4, and butter and line two 20cm sandwich tins.</p> <p>Put all of the above ingredients, except the milk, into a food processor. Process to a smooth batter, and then add the milk a tablespoon at a time to make a soft dropping consistency. Divide between the two cake tins and bake for 20 minutes. The cakes will have risen and feel spookily puffy; this is because of the cornflour in the custard powder.</p> <p>Let the tins sit on a cooling rack for 5 minutes and then turn them out on to the rack, peeling away the paper.</p> <p>To make the buttercream filling, process the icing sugar and custard powder to get rid of any lumps, and then add the butter, processing again to make the buttercream come together. Feed the boiling water down the funnel with the motor running to make the filling easier to spread. Then sandwich the cooled sponges together with the custardy buttercream.</p> <p>To make the chocolate icing, combine the water, syrup and sugar in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve over a low heat. Let it come to the boil and then take it off the heat.</p> <p>Break up the chocolate into small pieces if you are not using chocolate buttons (as I do for cooking, but good quality not confectionary standard), and then add to the pan, swirling it around to cover in the hot liquid. Leave to melt for a few minutes, and then whisk the icing to make it smooth and shiny. Pour over the buttercream filled cake, letting it drip down the sides, and then sprinkle generously with the hundreds and thousands before the icing sets.</p> <p>Prong with candles, light them and sing.</p> <p><em>From <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feast-9780701189198.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Feast</a> by Nigella Lawson (</em><em>Chatto &amp; Windus, £30)</em></p>",

            body: "<p>My daughter Ivy was born on 23 December. We arrived home with her on Christmas morning, shellshocked, loved up and thoroughly knackered – just as many parents of newborns are. Christmas that year, not surprisingly, was a little different from others. I can’t quite remember how we even got through the day, to be honest. On Boxing Day, or shortly afterwards (time takes on a curious quality when you’re relentlessly sleep-deprived), a baker friend dropped round with a cake (disclaimer: dropping round on somebody post-birth can elicit joy, but also visceral horror at the thought of having to greet anyone from the outside world, so do get permission first). “It’s got stout in it,” she said, and with that she was gone. The rumour goes, although I think it’s considered a bit of an old wives’ tale these days, that drinking stout is good for new mothers, improving iron and stimulating milk supply. I have no idea whether stout does help, but I do know that good cake is a salve and makes the world go round, especially for bleary-eyed new parents. This one is also incredibly easy to bake.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 8</strong></em><br><strong>stout</strong> 250ml <br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 230g <br><strong>unsweetened cocoa powder</strong> 70g <br><strong>rolled oats</strong> 50g, plus 2 tbsp more to sprinkle<br><strong>plain </strong><strong>flour </strong>200g <br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 250g, plus 1 tbsp more to sprinkle<br><strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong> 1½ tsp<br><strong>salt</strong> a big pinch <br><strong>eggs</strong> 2, beaten<br><strong>sour cream</strong> 150g, plus more to serve</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Line a 24cm cake tin with baking paper. Bring the stout and butter to a boil in a saucepan over a moderate heat. Add the cocoa and oats and whisk well until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool a little.</p> <p>Whisk the flour, sugar, bicarbonate of soda and big pinch of salt together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs and sour cream into the stout and cocoa mixture, mixing thoroughly to combine. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and fold together until the batter is completely combined.</p> <p>Pour the batter into the prepared tin and sprinkle with the extra sugar and oats. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p> <p>Remove from the oven and cool in the tin a little, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
